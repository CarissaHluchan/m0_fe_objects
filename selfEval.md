# Self-Evaluation


- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?


   The notes and practice set me up to solve all the challenges. I felt good


- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?


   I've been taking breaks when something gets too complex or I receive an error where I can not find the bug. When I come back I can normally figure out the answers. Staying focused is a challenge but the more I do the better it gets. I still need practice with problem-solving skills but I have already seen improvements in the last week.


- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?


   I wish I had the ability to maintain everything I learned but I took good notes and can always go back to my notes and exercises to remind me of a skills I've learned.
